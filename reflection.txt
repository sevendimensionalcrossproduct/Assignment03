Loops are an important part of structured, clean programming in JavaScript, and they work by executing a block of code several times based on certain iteration patterns subject to specific rules dictated by us the programmers. There's a variety of loops that exist in order for us to solve a problem as efficiently and cleanly as possible, in particular, we learned about the for loop (executes code based on an iterator variable until it reaches a specific value or otherwise loops infinitely), a while loop (executes code while a specific condition is true, such as a certain variable being a specific value or not) and the do while loop (executes code once without checking the condition, and then proceeds as a normal while loop). Finally, there's a couple extra for loops (namely for-in, which is used for objects and arrays and for-of, which is used for arrays), one of which is deprecated but still maintained because of legacy issues and backwards compatibility. In general, it was a good refresher, and something that surprised me was learning that JavaScript's .forEach() DOM method isn't actually counted as a traditional loop, and that the do while loop actually executes without checking the condition once, useful for routines that need to be executed at least once before the looping behavior begins.
